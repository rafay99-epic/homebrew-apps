  # auto-bumps both on each Stable cut (Vitals's .github/scripts/bump-cask.sh), so
  # nobody hand-edits a sha256. `livecheck` lets `brew livecheck` detect new
  # releases; Vitals also self-updates once installed.

  # The build is ad-hoc signed, not Apple-notarized. Strip the download
  # quarantine after install so Gatekeeper doesn't block first launch — this is
