  # The `nightly` tag is a single rolling pre-release whose Vitals-Nightly.dmg is
  # overwritten on every nightly build. The release CI re-pins version (= the
  # monotonic build number) + sha256 right after each build (Vitals's
  # .github/scripts/bump-cask.sh), so the checksum stays honest without anyone
  # hand-editing it. Vitals Nightly also self-updates from this feed. Installs
  # alongside the stable `vitals` cask — separate app, icon, settings, and data.
